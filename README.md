## About The Project
When you're tired of sending the same old text-based messages, share your most important moments with friends and family in a whole new way. WhatsSticky is a bot that converts any photo you send it into a sticker that can be shared on WhatsApp. WhatsSticky has a simple and intuitive interface. Just select an image from your phone, send it to the Bot and voila! You have an awesome whatsapp sticker ready to share with your friends.

The following graphic depicts the general architecture of the project.
